                    The Frontier begins on the leading edge of the Outer Veil,
                    crosses through the Outer Rim of the known territories, and
                    stretches on into deep space. Located between the core
                    systems and the Outer Rim, the Outer Veil is a vast region
                    of space that is abundantly rich in mineral resources. The
                    Outer Rim is extensively colonized, and the Colonial Navy
                    operates there. Past the Outer Rim is anyone’s guess—and
                    that thrill of the unknown is what draws pioneers here.
                    Settlers have likened the sometimes lawless Frontier to the
                    Old West of the United States.

                    Here, life is harsh and cheap. On many worlds, atmospheric
                    processors have been brought in to convert the air into
                    something passably breathable. The majority of settlers here
                    are prospectors, entrepreneurs, farmers, and homesteaders.
                    Mining worlds refine ores and fuel, while agri and aquatic
                    worlds harvest food and algae. Space stations such as
                    Anchorpoint serve as a neutral staging ground for
                    expeditions into deep space.

                    Neighboring colonies don’t always get along, and armed
                    conflicts over stakes and claims are not uncommon—often
                    requiring the Colonial Marines to step in and restore order.
                    The boundaries of the Frontier are ever-shifting, and
                    sometimes colonies switch hands as border disputes redefine
                    the map.
