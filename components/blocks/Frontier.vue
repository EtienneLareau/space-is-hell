                <h2>TERRITORIES OF THE FRONTIER</h2>
                <p>
                    While dominated by the United Americas, the Frontier is an
                    area intersected by several nation-states. An uneasy
                    alliance exists between them, yet territorial disputes are
                    not unheard of. What follows is a listing of the major
                    government players vying for resources there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three World Empire: Consisting of the former United Kingdom,
                    Japan, and several developing countries, the Weyland-Yutani
                    corporation itself is a result of the formation of the Three
                    World Empire—created when the UK company Weyland Corp merged
                    with the Japanese Yutani Corporation. The Three World Empire
                    pioneered space exploration, controls many long-established
                    inner colonies, and only maintains a limited presence on the
                    Frontier—allowing Weyland-Yutani to take the lead there.

                <p>
                    The United Americas: Created in the early 2100s to compete
                    with the expanding Three World Empire, the United Americas
                    was formed by the merger of North, Central, and South
                    America into one nation. The United Americas is a major
                    colonizing and starfaring power, constantly expanding the
                    Frontier. They operate both the Colonial Marines and the
                    Colonial Navy—the most powerful peace-keeping forces on the
                    Frontier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Union of Progressive Peoples: The UPP is a powerful
                    socialist block of systems that control a vast but resource
                    poor sector of space. Formed from a coalition of countries
                    that includes Russia and Vietnam, the UPP is the only
                    government that is not influenced by corporate concerns—a
                    fact that sometimes puts them in opposition to
                    Weyland-Yutani. While they are behind in the arms race, the
                    UPP still maintains a formidable fighting force. A state of
                    cold war has existed between the United Americas and the UPP
                    for decades, but with recent events on the Frontier, all
                    that seems poised to change.

                    The Independent Core System Colonies: The ICSC is a loose
                    conglomerate of privately-owned worlds. Each colony in the
                    ICSC has its own government—many of which are
                    corporate-owned. In addition to its operations within the
                    colonies of the United Americas and the Three World Empire,
                    Weyland-Yutani is known to maintain private interests in the
                    ICSC—where they can conduct business as they see fit, far
                    from the prying eyes of government control.
